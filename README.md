About the Challenge
This frontend challenge will be a CSS heavy. You'll use a CSS Grid/Flexbox and a lot of cool CSS Properties.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.

Challenge Requirements
The page should contain three pricing cards, each with a different pricing plan and a list of features.
Display both monthly and annual pricing to users.
Users should have the option to switch between monthly and annual pricing by clicking on the Toggle button.
Show the hover state of all the elements.
The component should be responsive and display correctly on different screen sizes.
Make this landing page look as close to the design as possible.
Taking your Project to the Next Level
Use a framework like React, Vue, or Svelte. Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla JavaScript.
